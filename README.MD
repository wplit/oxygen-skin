For Mac users only. completely pointless plugin, apart from if you hate Source Sans Pro like me.

This plugin just removes the google fonts from the Oxygen builder UI and replaces with Avenir Next. There is also some extra styling added to make the UI better suit the font.

More minimalism, less google fonts. Looks better if you have retina screen due to thin font weights.
